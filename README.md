An application that shows some special places in Barcelona with informations from Wikipedia.

## Read informations from Wikipedia

Click on a marker in the map or on a location in the list. In the opened infowindow click *"SHOW MORE"*.

## Locations list

If you are a *mobile user*, click on the hamburger icon to show the list.

To *filter* locations by name, just write what you want to search in the input box.
